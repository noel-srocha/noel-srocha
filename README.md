## Hello! My name is Manoel!

<div align="justfy">

  I'm a 30-years-old Brazilian who loves coding, learning new things about life and technologies, ah and also about astronomy! I practice programming everyday and right now, I'm quite in love with Dart and Flutter!

  Currently, I work as a Systems Analyst and I'm having quite a lot of fun, because the environment I'm in allows me to Research & Develop as much as I please. This is also where I'm gaining experience with C# and .NET Core for building modern web applications.

  And in case you're wondering... Yep, I'm a fan of Peaky Blinders! haha
